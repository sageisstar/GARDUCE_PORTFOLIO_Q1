    <td colspan="3">Throughout the lessons of 1st Quarter in ICT, I have learned the basics of creating an html website or web page.<br>
    These elements of the html could help improve the user experience by adding interactive, organized, and useful elements.<br>
    These websites could be used for any means such as education, work, entertainment, and so on. Learning how to code<br>
    for these websites would be useful to people interested in making one. As technology evolves, it is a must that we use these<br>
    elements for the betterment and it may also help to save the environment through the digital way. Now, coding may seem<br>
    difficult or take MONTHS for you to finish it, I assure you that once you get used to it and get the codes correct immediately,<br>
    it would be much more efficient and convinient. All that it takes is practice, practice. . . and practice! But, if it did take days,<br>
    I am sure that the website you're working on is really advanced and looks like a professional website. And now, I can't wait<br>
    to know more about coding in the 2nd quarter so that I could improve my coding. </td>
